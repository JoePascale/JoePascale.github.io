title: My Experience at Bloc
---

My experience so far with Bloc has been incredible.

I can already see the impact that a rapid learning process has had on my career, my investments in my self, and even my personal life.

I never would have imagined 3 months ago that I would have learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, & AngularJS by now, but more importantly be empowered to and know exactly where to go to continue the learning process on my own.

The biggest takeaway I have had from the program so far is that I am never done learning, nor should I ever be.  There is an infinite wealth of knowledge from all perspectives of the software development world and I can always get better, learn more, and become a better developer.

I'm excited about what the future holds.
