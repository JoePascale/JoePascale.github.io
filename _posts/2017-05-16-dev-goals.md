title: My Goals as a Developer
---

My goals as a developer are two-fold:

1. Continuously learn more about both myself and software (Never stop learning)

-and-

2. Discover what I can do to improve the world by helping real people solve real world problems


I've always had a fascination with the talents that each and every person has.  One can never learn all there is to know in even a thousand lifetimes, but what I do have the power to do is highlight and complement those skills that other people have.

Whether it is designing the latest greatest fitness app, a personal financial management app, or even an app to manage small business expenses, the idea is that I want to help empower people to do what they do best.

That's the beautiful part about software...there truly is no limit to what we can design and improve so that people in the real world can benefit.

That's the type of passion I'd like to take on when learning new languages, development lifecycles, or ways to test and improve software.
