title: My Biggest Challenge When Learning to Develop
---

I think my biggest challenge while learning to develop has been finding the right way to do things.

Sometimes there's a right way, and then there's a "right-er" way.  Learning best practices are important to me and sometimes the obvious & quick answer isn't always the best one in ambitious projects.

I find that investing time in improving my code, making it less verbose, making it more clear, and structuring it in a way that is easy to test and revisit makes a world of difference.

It's been fun learning on how to make things better (i.e. writing a shorter Javascript function), but the challenge is always in figuring out what that method may be.
