There's a lot to be said about someone who has a breadth of experiences.  Originally from a sales & account management background, I decided to dip my toes into the world of software development after realizing that my strongest abilities lie with helping people and solving real-world problems for them!

My core competencies include Javascript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Angular, Node.js, Rails, SQL, & Git, but I there are plenty more I'm familiar with and I am always open to learning new things!
